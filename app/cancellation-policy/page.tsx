          Because passengers pay drivers in cash after a trip, cancelling a
          booking does not involve a refund. There is no deposit to lose and no
          money to claw back — which is why this policy is short.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a cancellation does affect is the other person&apos;s plans, so we
          record every one and expect both sides to cancel early rather than
          late.

          You can cancel a booking from the app up until the trip starts. You will
          be asked for a reason, which is stored with the booking.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Well before pickup</strong> — cancel in the app. The driver is

          <li>
            <strong>Close to pickup</strong> — cancel in the app and call the
            support line, so the Gari Bhai can reach the driver directly if they
            are already on the way.

          A confirmed booking is a commitment. Cancel only when you genuinely
          cannot run the trip — a breakdown, illness, a document problem — and do
          it as early as you can.

        <ul>

            Cancellation rate is part of your standing on the platform. A pattern
            of late cancellations or no-shows can suspend your access to bookings.

          If one side does not appear at the agreed pickup point, the other should
          call the support line rather than simply leaving. The Gari Bhai on the
          booking will try to reach both parties before the trip is marked as a
          no-show.

          A no-show is recorded against the account responsible for it, and is
          treated more seriously than an early cancellation.

          A different pickup time, an extra stop or a changed drop-off does not
          always need a cancellation. Speak to the Gari Bhai on your booking: if
          both sides agree, the change — and any change to the fare — is recorded
          against the booking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not agree a new fare informally at the roadside. If it is not in the
          app, it is not on record, and we cannot help if it is disputed later.

          Cancellation rules are configurable and may become stricter as the
          platform grows — for example, fees for very late cancellations. Any such
          change will be announced in the app before it takes effect and reflected
          here.
