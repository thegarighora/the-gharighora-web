/**
 * Home page — the overview. Each section states its case briefly and then hands
 * off to a dedicated page for the detail.
 *
 * Section order is deliberate: the empty-return-leg insight comes before the
 * product, so Return Car reads as an obvious idea rather than a feature list.
 * All colours and gradients come from app/theme.css — see that file to rebrand.
