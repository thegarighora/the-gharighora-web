          {siteConfig.name} operates a marketplace that connects passengers who
          need a car with drivers who have one. These terms apply to the

          {siteConfig.name} does not own vehicles and does not employ drivers.
          Drivers on the platform are independent operators who provide the
          transport themselves. What we provide is the platform that matches you,
          records the agreed fare, and supports the booking while it runs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means the transport contract for a trip is between the passenger
          and the driver. We verify drivers before they can accept trips and we
          assign an operations agent to bookings, but we are not the carrier.

        <p>
          A booking is created when a passenger accepts a driver&apos;s offer, or
          a driver accepts a passenger&apos;s request. Offers and counter-offers
          happen inside the app and are limited to a small number of rounds.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The fare is fixed on acceptance.</strong> Neither side may
            change it afterwards without agreement recorded through the platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bookings are for the whole vehicle.</strong> We do not sell
            individual seats, and a driver may not add other passengers to your
            trip.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Offers can expire.</strong> An offer that is not accepted
            within its window lapses, and the trip stays open to others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only one accepted offer can exist for a trip. The platform prevents
            conflicting acceptances.
          </li>

          {siteConfig.name} does not process passenger payments and does not hold
          your money. There is no deposit and no advance payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount payable is the fare agreed in the app. If a trip genuinely
          changes — a different drop-off, a wait you asked for — raise it with the
          operations agent on your booking so the change is recorded rather than
          settled informally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drivers owe {siteConfig.name} a commission on completed trips. That is
          a matter between the driver and us and is never added to the
          passenger&apos;s fare.

          Either side can cancel a booking, and every cancellation records who
          cancelled, when and why. Because no money changes hands before a trip,
          a cancellation does not leave anyone chasing a refund.
