                Rent a car from Dhaka to Cumilla and the driver takes you there,
                drops you off, and drives home alone. The fuel, the hours and the
                wear on that return leg are real costs, and they end up inside
                the fare everyone pays.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile, somebody in Cumilla is trying to get to Dhaka that
                evening and paying full price for a second car to make the exact
                same journey in the opposite direction.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="font-semibold text-brand-ink">
                  Those two people should be in the same car.
                </strong>{" "}
                That is the whole idea. GhariGhora lets a driver post the empty
                leg as a Return Car trip, and lets a passenger book it for a
                fraction of a fresh rental — the driver earns twice on one
                journey, the passenger travels cheaper, and one less car makes an
                empty run.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rental Car sits alongside it because the two feed each other:
                today&apos;s rental is tomorrow&apos;s return trip.
