          optional, we say so.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Phone number</strong> — the account identifier, verified by
            one-time password.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Name and profile photo</strong> — so the person you are
            meeting knows who to look for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email and address</strong> — optional for passengers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trip data</strong> — routes, dates, times, notes on a booking,
            offers, bookings, trips, cancellations and ratings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support history</strong> — what you reported and what we did
            about it, including notes made by the operations agent on your
            booking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device and usage data</strong> — app version, device type and
            basic diagnostics, used to fix crashes and abuse.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>From drivers only</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>NID, driving licence and vehicle registration</strong> — used
            to verify that a driver is who they say they are and that the vehicle
            is theirs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vehicle details and photos</strong> — shown to passengers so
            they can identify the car.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Earnings, commission and settlement records</strong> — needed
            to run the financial side of the platform.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>
          Driver location is used while a trip is active, so the passenger can see
          the car approaching and so support can help if something goes wrong. We
          do not build long-term movement histories, and we do not track drivers
          when they are not on a trip.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Passengers are not asked for NID</strong> to open an account or
          make a normal booking.
